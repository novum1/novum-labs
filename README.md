  Starter for NovumLabs

## 🚀 Detail Analysis of the Project

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Currently, time is not wasted making plans, but it begins to be implemented directly on a prototype. That is what I am doing here. A perfectly functional site to determine the needs.

    ```shell
    # to see it working just clone this repo, then navigate to it
    cd novum-labs

    #then start the gatsby application
    npm run develop
    #or
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Implementation of the skeleton prototype.**

    In this part I will implement all the graphic elements of the site so that it looks and works correctly.

3.  **Finalizing the project**

    In this phase we will correct all the errors and adjustments will be made so that the site works as you want.
